# **Introduction**

When i was learning Android Pentesting i came across various frameworks and many of them were either good or didn't work for me. One of the frameworks i liked the most was Xposed Framwork. When i was learning the framework it was little bit hard for me to catch up since i was new to Android and Java too. So this is my small step to make it easier for people who want to learn Xposed Framework.

# **What is Xposed Framework**

Well in simple words i can say that it can help you to alter the behaviour of application by adding the code without altering a single line of code in the `apk`. With Xposed your add on code will work on different ROM's and even different version and it will be super easy to remove your code to. You just have to remove the module that's all.

For sake of learning we are going to use Xposed Framework to bypass the password check in [`ListLock apk`](https://github.com/GDSSecurity/SubstrateDemo/tree/master/ListLock%20APK). For this tutorial you should have following application in your machine.

1. Genymotiion or any other emulator with Android device (Android 4.4 - API 19)
2. Root with [`SuperSu`](http://supersuroot.org/downloads/SuperSU-v2.76-20160704164356.apk) in Android device.
4. [`Android Debug Bridge`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb)
3. Android Studio or Eclipse (I'll use Eclipse since i don't have powerful PC to run Android Studio.)

You should also have knowledge of Java Programing Language. So let's start.

# **Installing Xposed in Android Device**

Dowload the Xposed apk from `[here](https://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer)`. To install the apk in your Android device use the following adb commands.

`adb connect <IP address of Android Device>`

`adb install <apk to install>`

After successful installation you should reboot the device.

On opening the app you can check the module section is empty.

# **Installing ListLock apk and Checking it**

Now let's install the listlock apk which you have downloaded from the above link. The installation process is same as always.

`adb install <listlock apk>`

Now after successful installation you can open listlock apk and you will see the following activity infront of you.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZuk0/matrix/master/assets/Xposed%20101/listlock.png)

You can try to login using random password. But it will not work.

# **Reversing the APK**

Now let's decompile the apk and see what classes are there and which methods are responsible for authentication. To decompile it we are going to convert the apk from dex to jar file using `d2j-dex2jar` tool which you can download from [`here`](https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar)

> **NOTE** : You can install Santoku VM which already have all the tools required for Mobile forensics.

To convert the dex to class files use the following command.

`d2j-dex2jar <apk file>`

it will create a jar file.

Now let's open the jar file using [`jd-gui`](http://java-decompiler.github.io/). Use the following command to open the jar file in `jd-gui`.

`jd-gui <apk-file>`

Now in `jd-gui` you will see the following.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZuk0/matrix/master/assets/Xposed%20101/jd-gui1.png)

In left side we can see there is `Authenticate` class present. Let's see what there.

![iamge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZuk0/matrix/master/assets/Xposed%20101/jd-gui2.png)

We can see that the `Authenticate` class have three methods `getSavedPassword`, `validatePassword` and `validatePassword`. We can observe that the entire login process depends on whether the `validatePassword` with 2 argument returns `True` or `False`. So out object will be to change the paramters of `validatePassword` with 2 arguments before calling that functions so that it will return True no matter what we enter. So let's jump right in to develop our Xposed Module.

# **Building Module**

So first let's download our Xposed API from [`here`](https://jcenter.bintray.com/de/robv/android/xposed/api/). For now I am using API-53.

Now let's create the Android Application project with empty activity in Eclipse. The Application Name and Project Name will be `Bypass` and the Package name will be `tools.listlock.bypass`.

Now create a `lib` folder inside the Project directory and copy the `api-53.jar` into that folder. Refresh it and then right click on the `api-53.jar` in eclipse and select `Build Path -> Add to Path`. Now create a class in src folder with class name `Bypass` and package name `tools.listlock.bypass`. After successful creation you will see something like this.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZuk0/matrix/master/assets/Xposed%20101/jd-gui3.png)

Now add the following code in your `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="tool.listlock.bypass"
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="1.0" >

    <uses-sdk
        android:minSdkVersion="15"/>

    <application
        android:icon="@drawable/ic_launcher"
        android:label="@string/app_name">
        
        <meta-data 
            android:name="xposedmodule"
            android:value="true"/>
        <meta-data 
            android:name="xposeddiscription"
            android:value="This is the module to bypass the listlock password validation"/>
        <meta-data 
            android:name="xposedminversion"
            android:value="53"/>
        
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Here we are declaring meta-data for xposed to recognize this as xposed module. In first `meta-data` we are declaring that this is a xposed module by setting value equals to true. Second `meta-data` is just giving description about xoposed module and third `meta-data` is declaring the `api-version` we are using which is 53. Save the xml file and let's move forward.

Now it's time to do some coding in java. Go to `Bypass.java` file inside src folder. After opening you will se something like this.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZuk0/matrix/master/assets/Xposed%20101/bypass1.png)

So let's get started. First let's import some useful `API's` which we are going to use

```java
import de.robv.android.xposed.IXposedHookLoadPackage;
import de.robv.android.xposed.XposedBridge;
import de.robv.android.xposed.callbacks.XC_LoadPackage.LoadPackageParam;
import de.robv.android.xposed.XC_MethodHook;
import static de.robv.android.xposed.XposedHelpers.findAndHookMethod;
```

`IXposedHookLoadPackage` : Get notified when an app ("Android package") is loaded. This is especially useful to hook some app-specific methods. This interface should be implemented by the module's main class. Xposed will take care of registering it as a callback automatically.

`XposedBridge` : This class contains most of Xposed's central logic, such as initialization and callbacks used by the native side. It also includes methods to add new hooks.

`LoadPackageParam` : Wraps information about the app being loaded.

`XC_MethodHook` : Callback class for method hooks. Usually, anonymous subclasses of this class are created which override beforeHookedMethod(XC_MethodHook.MethodHookParam) and/or afterHookedMethod(XC_MethodHook.MethodHookParam).

`findAndHookMethod` : Look up a method and hook it.

Now 2nd step let's implement IXposedHookLoadPackage into our main Bypass class.

```java
public Bypass implements IXposedHookLoadPackage {

}
```
and then add the following code inside the class

```java
public void handleLoadPackage(final LoadPackageParam lpparm) throws Throwable {
                if (!lpparm.packageName.equals("com.historypeats.listlock")) {
                        return;
                }

                XposedBridge.log("Package " + lpparm.packageName + " is loaded");

                findAndHookMethod("com.historypeats.listlock.classes.Authenticate", lpparm.classLoader, "validatePassword", String.class, String.class, new XC_MethodHook() {
                        @Override
                        protected void beforeHookedMethod(MethodHookParam param) throws Throwable {
                                
                                XposedBridge.log("The 1st argument before : " + param.args[0]);
                                XposedBridge.log("The 2nd argument before : " + param.args[1]);
                                param.args[0] = param.args[1];
                        }
                        
                        @Override
                        protected void afterHookedMethod(MethodHookParam param) throws Throwable {
                            
                                XposedBridge.log("The 1st argument after : " + param.args[0]);
                                XposedBridge.log("The 2nd argument after : " + param.args[1]);
                        }
                });

        }
```

Here we are using `handleLoadPackage` api which is called when an app is loaded with app infomation as an argument. first we are checking if the loaded package is `com.historypeats.listlock`. Then we are using `XposedBrige.log` to log in the logcat. Then we are using `findAndHookMethod` which is going to locate the `validPassword` inside the `Authenticate` class. The Arguments of this methods are `Absolute path of the class`, `classLoader of the app`, `function to search`, `arg 1`, `arg 2` , and last the `XC_MethodHook` class. We are passing an anonymous class in this example.

Inside the `findAndHookMethod` we are Overriding two method `beforeHookMethod` and `afterHookMethod`. Here `beforeMethodHook` is executed before calling the hooked method and `afterMethodHook` is execute after calling the hooked method.

Here we `beforeHookMethod` we are logging the value of 2 arguments before calling the hooked method and then initializing the arument so that they both will be same and in `afterhookMethod` we are just logging the value of both argument.

In the end the code should look like this.

Now final step. Let's create a file with name `xposed_init` inside the assets folder and enter the absolute path of the class which should be loaded. Here we have to enter `tool.listlock.bypass.Bypass` and save the file.

# **Loading the Module**

Now run the Android Project in the Android Device. It will load the module in the Xposed as shown below. 

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZuk0/matrix/master/assets/Xposed%20101/notactive.png)

Now go to Xposed app and then select module as shown below and then reboot it.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZuk0/matrix/master/assets/Xposed%20101/checked.png)

Now go to logs in xposed app. If you get the following then module is successfully loaded.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZuk0/matrix/master/assets/Xposed%20101/moduleload.png)

# **Bypass**

Now open the ListLocker app and then enter anything and try to login. You will succesfully log into the application. If you'll see the logcat you can see the log produced by Xposed as shown below.
